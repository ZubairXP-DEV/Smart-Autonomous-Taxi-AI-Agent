## Taxi Types & Fleet

### Three Taxi Types

#### 1. Economy Taxi 🚕
- **Capacity**: 1 passenger
- **Fleet Distribution**: 60% (most common)
- **Speed**: Normal (1 unit per step)
- **Icon**: 🚕
- **Use Case**: Standard single-passenger rides
- **Colors**:
  - Idle: Yellow (#fbbf24)
  - Picking Up: Light Orange (#fb923c)
  - Transporting: Green (#10b981)

#### 2. Premium Taxi 🚗
- **Capacity**: 2 passengers (ride sharing)
- **Fleet Distribution**: 30%
- **Speed**: Normal (1 unit per step)
- **Icon**: 🚗
- **Use Case**: Small groups, ride sharing for 2
- **Colors**:
  - Idle: Orange (#f59e0b)
  - Picking Up: Orange (#f97316)
  - Transporting: Dark Green (#059669)

#### 3. Luxury Taxi 🏎️
- **Capacity**: 3 passengers (maximum ride sharing)
- **Fleet Distribution**: 10% (rarest)
- **Speed**: Normal (1 unit per step)
- **Icon**: 🏎️
- **Use Case**: Large groups, maximum efficiency
- **Colors**:
  - Idle: Dark Orange (#d97706)
  - Picking Up: Red-Orange (#ea580c)
  - Transporting: Darker Green (#047857)

### Fleet Distribution Example

With 10 taxis:
- **Economy**: 6 taxis (60%)
- **Premium**: 3 taxis (30%)
- **Luxury**: 1 taxi (10%)

**Total Capacity**: 6×1 + 3×2 + 1×3 = 15 passengers

### Key Differences

| Feature | Economy | Premium | Luxury |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| Capacity | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Fleet % | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| Ride Sharing | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Max Passengers/Trip | 1 | 2 | 3 |

**Important Note**: All taxi types move at the same speed. The difference is **capacity**, not speed.

## Priority System

### Three Priority Levels

#### 1. Emergency 🚨 (Highest Priority)
- **Priority Score**: 3
- **Spawn Rate**: 5% of passengers
- **Max Wait Time**: 100 steps
- **Revenue Multiplier**: 2.0x ($20.00 per ride)
- **Icon**: 🚨
- **Color**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Marker Size**: Large (28px)
- **Use Case**: Urgent medical/emergency situations

#### 2. VIP ⭐ (High Priority)
- **Priority Score**: 2
- **Spawn Rate**: 15% of passengers
- **Max Wait Time**: 300 steps
- **Revenue Multiplier**: 1.5x ($15.00 per ride)
- **Icon**: ⭐
- **Color**: Orange (#f59e0b)
- **Marker Size**: Medium (24px)
- **Use Case**: Premium/preferred customers

#### 3. Regular 👤 (Standard Priority)
- **Priority Score**: 1
- **Spawn Rate**: 80% of passengers
- **Max Wait Time**: 500 steps
- **Revenue Multiplier**: 1.0x ($10.00 per ride)
- **Icon**: 👤
- **Color**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Marker Size**: Small (20px)
- **Use Case**: Standard passengers

### Priority Assignment

When a passenger spawns:
```python
rand = random.random()
if rand < 0.05:          # 0-5% = Emergency
    priority = "emergency"
elif rand < 0.20:        # 5-20% = VIP
    priority = "vip"
else:                    # 20-100% = Regular
    priority = "regular"
```

### Priority Impact on Assignment

**Selection Criteria**:
1. **Priority Score** (PRIMARY) - Higher priority always selected first
2. **Distance** (SECONDARY) - Only matters when priorities are equal

**Example**:
- Emergency passenger at distance 10 → Selected
- Regular passenger at distance 1 → Not selected (even though closer)

**Priority ALWAYS overrides distance!**

### Priority Impact on Revenue

Base fare: $10.00

- **Emergency**: $10 × 2.0 = **$20.00**
- **VIP**: $10 × 1.5 = **$15.00**
- **Regular**: $10 × 1.0 = **$10.00**

## Passenger Assignment Mechanism

### How Taxis Find Passengers

The system uses a **decentralized "pull" model** where taxis actively search for passengers (not a central dispatch system).

### Assignment Process

#### Step 1: Passenger Spawns
- Passenger appears at random road position
- Status: `"waiting"`
- Position added to grid

#### Step 2: Taxis Scan (Every Simulation Step)
All idle taxis simultaneously scan for passengers:

```python
for agent in self.model.schedule.agents:
    if isinstance(agent, Passenger) and agent.status == "waiting":
        if len(self.passengers) < self.capacity:  # Check capacity
            distance = calculate_distance(taxi.position, passenger.position)
            priority_score = get_priority_score(passenger.priority)
            # Store for evaluation
```

#### Step 3: Taxi Evaluates & Selects
Each taxi independently:
1. Collects all available passengers (status = "waiting")
2. Calculates distance to each
3. Gets priority score for each
4. Sorts by: **Priority (descending), then Distance (ascending)**
5. Selects the best match

#### Step 4: Taxi Commits (Assignment Happens)
```python
self.status = "picking_up"  # Taxi commits!
pickup_location = selected_passenger.position
self.path = calculate_path(taxi.position, pickup_location)
```

**This is the moment of assignment**: Taxi sets status to `"picking_up"` and calculates route.

#### Step 5: Taxi Moves to Passenger
- Taxi follows calculated path
- Moves one position per step
- Checks if reached passenger location

#### Step 6: Pickup Complete
```python
if self.position == pickup_location:
    self.passengers.append(passenger)
    passenger.status = "in_taxi"
    self.status = "transporting"
```

### Assignment Rules

1. **Priority Overrides Distance**
   - Emergency always selected before VIP
   - VIP always selected before Regular
   - Distance only matters for same priority

2. **Capacity Constraints**
   - Economy: Can only pick 1 passenger
   - Premium: Can pick up to 2 passengers
   - Luxury: Can pick up to 3 passengers

3. **Competition Handling**
   - Multiple taxis can choose the same passenger
   - First taxi to arrive wins
   - Other taxis re-evaluate next step

### How to Identify Assignment in Dashboard

1. **Visual Connection Lines**
   - Colored line connects taxi to passenger
   - Line color = passenger priority color

2. **Passenger Tooltip**
   - Shows "Taxi #X coming!" if assigned

3. **Click Passenger**
   - Modal shows "Taxi Assignment" section
   - Displays: Taxi ID, Type, Status, Position, Distance

4. **Click Taxi**
   - Modal shows "Picking Up" section
   - Shows which passenger taxi is heading to

## Distance & Proximity Detection

### Two-Stage Proximity System

#### Stage 1: Initial Selection (Manhattan Distance)

**Manhattan Distance Formula**:
```
Distance = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
```

**Example**:
```
Taxi at (5, 3)
Passenger at (8, 7)

Manhattan Distance = |5-8| + |3-7| = 3 + 4 = 7 units
```

**Why Manhattan Distance?**
- Fast calculation (O(1))
- Good approximation for grid-based movement
- Used only for initial selection/ranking

#### Stage 2: Exact Position Check (After Pathfinding)

After selecting a passenger, taxi:
1. Uses NetworkX pathfinding to calculate actual route
2. Moves step-by-step along path
3. Checks: `taxi.position == passenger.position` (exact match)
4. When positions match → Pickup occurs

### Why Two Stages?

- **Manhattan Distance**: Fast heuristic for selection
- **Pathfinding**: Accurate route through road network
- **Exact Position Check**: Precise pickup confirmation

**Note**: Manhattan distance and actual path distance can differ because pathfinding follows road network, not straight lines.

---

## Pathfinding & Routing

### Pathfinding Algorithm

Uses **NetworkX shortest_path** algorithm:
- Finds shortest path through road network
- Respects road connectivity
- Handles obstacles and road structure

### Route Planning for Multiple Passengers

**Nearest-Neighbor Approach**:
1. Start from current position
2. Find nearest destination
3. Plan route to that destination
4. Repeat for remaining destinations

### Traffic Light Awareness

Taxis check traffic lights before moving:
- If red light in movement direction → Wait
- If green light → Proceed
- Allows adaptive traffic flow

## Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Average Wait Time**
   - Average time passengers wait before pickup
   - Lower is better

2. **Taxi Utilization**
   - Percentage of taxis that are active
   - Optimal range: 50-80%

3. **Traffic Density**
   - Percentage of road cells occupied
   - Higher = more congestion

4. **Total Passengers Served**
   - Cumulative count of completed trips

5. **Revenue**
   - Total earnings from all trips
   - Breakdown by taxi type and passenger priority

6. **Performance Score**
   - Composite metric (0-100)
   - Factors: Wait time, utilization, coverage, waiting passengers

### Performance Scoring

**Formula**:
```
Score = (Wait_Score × 0.4) + (Util_Score × 0.3) + (Coverage_Score × 0.2) - (Wait_Penalty × 0.1)
```

**Status Levels**:
- 75-100: Excellent (Green)
- 50-74: Good (Yellow)
- 0-49: Needs Improvement (Red)
