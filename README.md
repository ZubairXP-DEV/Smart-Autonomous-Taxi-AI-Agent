# 🚕 Smart Autonomous Taxi & Traffic System

A professional AI-powered city simulation demonstrating how intelligent agents (self-driving taxis, passengers, and adaptive traffic lights) work together to optimize urban traffic and reduce wait times.

---

## 🎯 What This Does

This system simulates a smart city with:
- **Self-driving taxis** that automatically find and pick up passengers using shortest-path routing
- **Smart traffic lights** that adapt to real-time traffic conditions
- **Priority passengers** (Emergency, VIP, Regular) with different service levels
- **Ride sharing** - Multiple passengers can share taxis
- **Real-time analytics** showing performance metrics and visualizations
- **Professional dashboard** with advanced analytics, cost analysis, and data export

Think of it like a video game where:
- **Taxis** are the cars driving around
- **Passengers** are people who need rides
- **Traffic Lights** control the roads

But instead of a game, it's a **simulation** that helps us understand how to make city traffic better!

## 🎯 What Each Agent Does

### **1. Taxi Agent** 🚕

**What it does:**
- Drives around the city looking for passengers
- Uses shortest-path routing (NetworkX) to find best routes
- Picks up passengers based on priority (Emergency > VIP > Regular)
- Supports ride sharing (can carry multiple passengers)
- Avoids traffic jams and respects traffic lights

**How it's smart:**
- Uses GPS-like navigation to find the best route
- Prioritizes higher priority passengers first
- Plans efficient routes for multiple passengers
- Knows when traffic lights are red and waits

**Taxi Types:**
- **Economy** (60% of fleet) - Capacity: 1 passenger
- **Premium** (30% of fleet) - Capacity: 2 passengers
- **Luxury** (10% of fleet) - Capacity: 3 passengers

**Status Colors:**
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Idle (looking for passengers)
- 🟠 **Orange** = Picking up passenger
- 🟢 **Green** = Transporting passenger to destination

---

### **2. Passenger Agent** 👤

**What it does:**
- Appears at random locations in the city
- Waits for a taxi to pick them up
- Has a destination to reach
- Gets in the taxi and rides to destination
- Disappears when they reach their destination

**Priority Levels:**
- **Emergency** (5% spawn rate) - Highest priority, 2x fare, max wait: 100 steps
- **VIP** (15% spawn rate) - High priority, 1.5x fare, max wait: 300 steps
- **Regular** (80% spawn rate) - Standard priority, 1x fare, max wait: 500 steps

**Visual Indicators:**
- **🚨 Red Triangle** = Emergency passenger
- **⭐ Orange Star** = VIP passenger
- **👤 Blue Circle** = Regular passenger

---

### **3. Traffic Light Agent** 🚦

**What it does:**
- Controls traffic at intersections
- Changes from green to red and back
- Adapts timing based on traffic density

**How it's smart:**
- Watches how many vehicles are waiting
- If many cars are waiting in one direction, stays green longer
- If no cars are coming, switches to help other traffic
- Works automatically - no human needed!

**Colors:**
- 🟢 **Green** = Traffic can go
- 🔴 **Red** = Traffic must stop

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

1. **Passenger appears** → Red marker shows up on the map
2. **Taxi sees passenger** → Taxi prioritizes by type (Emergency > VIP > Regular)
3. **Taxi picks up** → Passenger gets in, taxi can pick up more if has capacity
4. **Taxi drives to destination** → Uses shortest route, follows traffic lights
5. **Passenger arrives** → Passenger disappears, taxi turns yellow again

**Meanwhile:**
- Traffic lights watch the traffic
- If many taxis are coming, lights stay green longer
- If no traffic, lights switch to help other directions
- Rush hours increase passenger spawn rate (2x during rush periods)

## 📊 Understanding the Metrics

### **Key Performance Indicators:**

1. **Average Wait Time**
   - Lower is better
   - Shows how quickly passengers get picked up
   - Should be under 50 steps for good performance

2. **Taxi Utilization**
   - Percentage of taxis actively working
   - 50-80% is healthy
   - Too high (>90%) = need more taxis
   - Too low (<30%) = too many taxis

3. **Traffic Density**
   - Overall congestion level
   - Watch how adaptive lights affect this
   - Lower is generally better

4. **Performance Score**
   - Overall system health (0-100)
   - Based on wait time, utilization, and coverage
   - 75+ = Excellent, 50-74 = Good, <50 = Needs improvement

## 🎨 Customizing the Simulation

Edit `dashboard/app.py` to change parameters:

```python
model_params = {
    "width": 30,              # City size (try 20-50)
    "height": 30,             # City size (try 20-50)
    "num_taxis": 10,          # Number of taxis (try 5-20)
    "num_traffic_lights": 8,  # Traffic lights (try 4-15)
    "passenger_spawn_rate": 0.1,  # Spawn probability (0.05-0.3)
    "enable_rush_hour": True,    # Enable rush hours
    "enable_weather": False      # Enable weather (optional)
}
```

Then restart the simulation to see changes.

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Agent** = A smart program that makes decisions (like a robot)
- Taxis are agents
- Passengers are agents  
- Traffic lights are agents

**Simulation** = A computer model that shows what would happen
- Not real, but shows real patterns
- Can test different scenarios
- Helps make better decisions

**AI-Driven** = The agents make smart decisions automatically
- Taxis find best routes
- Traffic lights adapt to traffic
- Everything works together automatically

**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** = Each entity acts independently
- Agents make decisions based on their state
- Emergent behavior from individual actions
- Realistic simulation of complex systems

## 🎯 The Goal

**Reduce:**
- ⏱️ Passenger wait times
- 🚗 Traffic congestion
- ⛽ Fuel waste

**Increase:**
- ✅ Taxi efficiency
- 😊 Customer satisfaction
- 🏙️ City livability

## 📊 Data Sources

### **Where Does the Data Come From?**

**All data is generated internally by the simulation** - there are no external data sources, APIs, or databases.

### **Data Generation Process:**

1. **Simulation Creates Agents:**
   - Taxis spawn at random positions
   - Passengers spawn randomly with random destinations
   - Traffic lights placed at intersections
   - Road network generated using NetworkX

2. **Agents Generate Data:**
   - **Taxis:** Position, status, passengers, distance, revenue
   - **Passengers:** Position, wait time, priority, destination
   - **Traffic Lights:** Position, state, direction, timing

3. **Model Calculates Metrics:**
   - Average wait time (from passenger wait times)
   - Taxi utilization (active taxis / total taxis)
   - Traffic density (occupied cells / total cells)
   - Total passengers served (sum of all completed trips)

4. **Data Collectors Gather:**
   - `SimulationDataCollector` - Custom metrics every step
   - `Mesa DataCollector` - Built-in Mesa metrics
   - Dashboard reads directly from model state

### **Data Flow:**
```
Simulation Step
    ↓
Agents Act (Move, Wait, Change State)
    ↓
Data Collectors Gather Metrics
    ↓
Dashboard Reads Current State
    ↓
Charts and Grid Update
```

### **Key Points:**
- ✅ **No external APIs** - Everything is self-contained
- ✅ **No databases** - Data stored in memory
- ✅ **No file imports** - No CSV/JSON data files
- ✅ **Real-time generation** - Data created as simulation runs
- ✅ **Agent-driven** - Data comes from agent states and actions

**The simulation is a closed system that generates its own data!**
